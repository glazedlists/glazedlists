/**
 * A MatcherEditor which decorates a source MatcherEditor with functionality.
 * Specifically, this MatcherEditor is meant to act as a buffer for
 * MatcherEvents to smooth out disparities between the rate at which
 * MatcherEvents are produced by the source MatcherEditor and the rate at
 * which they are consumed by registered MatcherEditorListeners. <p>
 *
 * Internally, a {@link ThreadedMatcherEditor} enqueues MatcherEvents as they
 * they are received from the source MatcherEditor. The MatcherEvents on the
 * queue are fired by another Thread as rapidly as the MatcherEditorListeners
 * can consume them. Two methods exist on this class which enable subclasses
 * to customize aspects of processing queued MatcherEvents:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li> {@link #executeMatcherEventQueueRunnable(Runnable)} is consulted when
 *        a Thread must be selected to execute the given Runnable which will
 *        drain the queue of MatcherEvents. Subclasses may override to
 *        customize which Thread is used.
 *
 *   <li> {@link #coalesceMatcherEvents(List)} is used to compress
 *        many enqueued MatcherEvents into a single representative
 *        MatcherEvent. This implies a contract between all registered
 *        MatcherEditorListeners and this {@link ThreadedMatcherEditor} that
 *        guarantees that processing the coalesced MatcherEvent is equivalent
 *        to processing all MatcherEvents sequentially.
 * </ol>
 *
 * Typical usage patterns of ThreadedMatcherEditor resemble:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   MatcherEditor threadedMatcherEditor = new ThreadedMatcherEditor(new AnyMatcherEditor());
 *   FilterList filterList = new FilterList(new BasicEventList(), threadedMatcherEditor);
 * </pre>

     *        type, the last MatcherEvent is returned, regardless of previous
     *        MatcherEvents <p>
     *
     *   <li> if <code>matcherEvents</code> only contains a series of
     *        monotonically constraining MatcherEvents, the final MatcherEvent
     *        is returned <p>
     *
     *   <li> if <code>matcherEvents</code> only contains a series of
     *        monotonically relaxing MatcherEvents, the final MatcherEvent is
     *        returned <p>
     *
     *   <li> if <code>matcherEvents</code> contains both constraining and
     *        relaxing MatcherEvents, the final MatcherEvent is returned with
     *        its type as {@link MatcherEditor.Event#CHANGED}
     * </ol>
     *
     * Note that <code>1, 2,</code> and <code>3</code> above merely represent
     * safe optimizations of the type of MatcherEvent that can be returned.
     * It could also have been returned as a MatcherEvent with a type of
     * {@link MatcherEditor.Event#CHANGED} and be assumed to work correctly, though
     * potentially less efficiently, since it is a more generic type of change.
     * <p>
     *
     * Subclasses with the ability to fire precise MatcherEvents with fine grain
     * types (i.e. <code>relaxed</code> or <code>constrained</code>) when

     * may do so by overiding this method.
